## Factorial Hidden Markov Model

Also called a Fractorial HMM or FHMM.

An FHMM has M independent Markov chains of latent variables,
each of which can be in K states.
In general the time and space complexity for a HMM is quadratic in the number of states.
For a factorial HMM, the number of states is exponential in the number of latent Markov chains.
A naive implementation of exact Factorial HMM has computational complexity $ùëÇ({TK^{2M}})$ .
But using the independence of the hidden chains in the factorial HMM reduce complexity to $ùëÇ({TMK^{M+1}})$
(Ghahramani and Jordan, 1997).
However this is still exponential in the number of chains, which may limit it to low numbers.
For higher number of chains, approximate or variational approaches may be needed.

### Energy load disaggregation

Also known as Electricity disaggregation, or Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). 

Is frequently done using a Additive Factorial Hidden Markov Model.
In each state, the appliance consumes a power which can be modeled by a normal distribution with mean Œº and small variance œÉ.
The number of states is often just 2, ON or OFF.
