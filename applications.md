[Optimization of sensor deployment for acoustic detection and localization in terrestrial environments](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rse2.97).
We developed probabilistic algorithms for near‐optimal placement of sensors,
and for localization of the sound source as a function of spatial variation in sound pressure.
We employed a principled‐GIS tool for mapping soundscapes to test the methods on a tropical‐forest case study using gunshot sensors.
On hilly terrain, near‐optimal placement halved the required number of sensors compared to a square grid.
Using a Greedy heuristic for near‐optimal placement of detectors.

TMNR is a 25‐km2 area of mature tropical moist forest on undulating topography of 100–400 m elevation.
Detection frequently possible up to 500 m distance from a gun, but much rarer above 1000 m.
Predicted 79 devices within TMNR when applied to the soundscape from 829 gunshots on a 200‐m grid.
50 devices within TMNR (on a 750‐m grid) would achieve a residual detection‐failure probability of 0.237,
which is just bettered by near‐optimal placement of only 26 devices. 

onitoring in the Korup National Park in Cameroon using 12 passive acoustic devices
continuously recording for 2 years detected a high level of shooting within a 54‐km2 grid.

ew advances in radio communication promise the future capability for real‐time detection and localization of exploitation activity,
by linking networked devices to a base station. And are undergoing development for open‐source AudioMoth sensors (Hill et al. 2018)

Phonocardiography device.
Phonocardiogram (PCG), the recording of the sounds and murmurs made by heart during a cardiac cycle,
can be effectively employed to study and monitor the activities of heart.
Such sounds are typically recorded using a device called phonocardiograph.

Four locations are most often used to listen to the heart sounds,
which are named according to the positions where the valves can be best heard:

* Aortic area - centered at the second right intercostal space.
* Pulmonic area - in the second intercostal space along the left sternal border.
* Tricuspid area - in the fourth intercostal space along the left sternal edge.
* Mitral area - at the cardiac apex, in the fifth intercostal space on the midclavicular line.
