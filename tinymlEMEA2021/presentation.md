## Roasting coffee

![](./img/roasting-curve-annotated.png){width=70%}

::: notes

Needs to be very conscise.

Important is to stop the roasting at the right time
The best way is to wait for the 1st crack period to start
This is when the water in
and the beans pop like popcorn, making an audible sound

:::

## Doing it manually

::: notes

Possible for skilled operator
Requires constant attention. 3 minute period
Variability between operators, over time

Benefits of automation

Much less skill required
Increased consistency
Operator can do other things while machine runs
Easy to operate multiple machines

Excellent results, consistently, automatically
