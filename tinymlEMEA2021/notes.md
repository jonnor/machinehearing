# TODO

- Make cover photo
Coffee, roaster, MachineLearning, sound
- Create dummy slides for outline 
- Do soundcheck

# Planning

## Format
5 minutes lighting talk.
5 slides a 1 minute.
Or up to 10 slides a 30 seconds

High pace, high energy.
Simple and focused message
No questions slot

## Outline

- Introduction. Talk title, Name
- Roest. What they do
- Soundsensing. What we do
- Coffee roasting. Importance
- First crack. What is it, why track it
- Acoustic detection
- Demo. Video showing action
- CTA. Roest, Soundsensing

## Press-release info

Roest is a leading manufacturer of coffee-roasting machines.
Their award-winning sample roaster is used by high-end coffee makers all over the world,
and is the first commercially available coffee roaster that uses acoustic sensing.

Soundsensing is a leader in acoustic monitoring using Machine Learning.
Their IoT sensors are used to monitor noise levels in workplaces and cities,
and to monitor the condition of machines and processes in manufacturing and real-estate.

The model runs on a custom developed board using an STM32 microcontroller and the X-CUBE-AI machine learning toolkit.
Roest coffee machines have been shipping with this TinyML-powered feature since August 2020.


## Soundbites

Who here likes Coffee?
Who here likes Machine Learning?
Who here likes Microcontrollers?
Then you have come to the right talk!

Did you know that roasting coffee beans make them crack like popcorn?

During the roasting process the coffebeans heat up and
the water inside turns to steam.
This can be released abruptly through the hard shell,
resulting in an audible "crack".

Experienced coffee roasters often listen for these cracks.
But this requires constant virgilance,
making it hard to do other tasks at the same time.

But how do coffee-makers select their coffee?
Testing the coffe. Roasting chart.

Development process.
From the start and all the way to a validated solution,
system design, data collection, model development, and testing.
