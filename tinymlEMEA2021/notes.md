# TODO

- Make cover photo. Use on intro/outro
Coffee, roaster, MachineLearning, sound

- Make overlays have margins on each side. Box style

- Write script for what to say on each slide
- Find pictures for each slide
- Rehearse and time presentation. 3x

# Planning

## Format
4 minutes lighting talk.

##  Tilbakemeldinger fra Roest

Why acoustic first crack?

first crack
essensielt
en person
1 minutt etter first crack. Reduser power

100k maskiner out there. Operators listen manually for first crack.
Requires being present and alert all the time.
By, so that operator can do other things.
Prepare coffee
Evaluate coffee
Operate more machines.

Sample roasters are used in the coffee production value chain to ensure quality.
When coffee beans are sold/purcaseds

Sample 100 gram coffee
At the farm
At the outgoing distributors
At incoming distributors
Repacking

When you or your local coffee show buy quality coffee beans from reputable brands
Beans from the same batch has been sampled, roasted, cupped and scored multiple times

## Press-release info

Roest is a leading manufacturer of coffee-roasting machines.
Their award-winning sample roaster is used by high-end coffee makers all over the world,
and is the first commercially available coffee roaster that uses acoustic sensing.

Soundsensing is a leader in acoustic monitoring using Machine Learning.
Their IoT sensors are used to monitor noise levels in workplaces and cities,
and to monitor the condition of machines and processes in manufacturing and real-estate.

The model runs on a custom developed board using an STM32 microcontroller and the X-CUBE-AI machine learning toolkit.
Roest coffee machines have been shipping with this TinyML-powered feature since August 2020.


## Soundbites

Who here likes Coffee?
Who here likes Machine Learning?
Who here likes Microcontrollers?
Then you have come to the right talk!

Did you know that roasting coffee beans make them crack like popcorn?

During the roasting process the coffebeans heat up and
the water inside turns to steam.
This can be released abruptly through the hard shell,
resulting in an audible "crack".

Experienced coffee roasters often listen for these cracks.
But this requires constant virgilance,
making it hard to do other tasks at the same time.

But how do coffee-makers select their coffee?
Testing the coffe. Roasting chart.

Development process.
From the start and all the way to a validated solution,
system design, data collection, model development, and testing.
