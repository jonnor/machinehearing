# Acoustic detection of coffeebean cracking during roasting

## Presentation

June 07.
Video coming on TinyML Youtube channel.

## Abstract

Great coffee requires not just high quality coffee beans,
but also a roasting process that consistently brings out the desired flavor and aroma.
During the roasting the coffee beans will pop like popcorn ("cracking"),
and the sound of these cracks is a good indicator of the development stage of the coffee. 
By using MEMS microphones and on-edge analysis using machine learning (TinyML),
the Roest coffee roasters can use sound to automatically keep track of the roasting process.
This technology has been developed in a collaboration between Roest and Soundsensing,
and is shipping on Roest sample roaster since August 2020.
In this talk you will hear about this fun and practical application of TinyML,
and some of the challenges and solutions we found when deploying on-edge
machine learning in professional grade electronics products.
