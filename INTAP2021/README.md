## Title

IoT sensor system for automatic classification of noise

## Abstract

Environmental noise affects many people across many urbanized areas in the world,
and most countries and municipalities have ordinances that aim to regulate such noise emissions.
Environmental noise is often characterized by being a complex mixture of many time-dependent noise sources,
making it resource-intensive to determine the noise source and responsible entity.
Recent advances in machine learning has made it possible to automatically process the audio
and classify the noise.
In this demonstration we show an IoT sensor system that has been developed to automatically classify noise sources.
It uses deep neaural networks that can run either fully on-edge or using a hybrid edge/cloud architecture.
The systems is now being tested out at multiple locations in Norway.
