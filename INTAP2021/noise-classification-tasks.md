## Title
Task formulations for automatic classification of Environmental Noise 

## Abstract

Environmental noise is one of the types of pollution
that affects the most people in the urbanized areas of the world.
Most countries and muncipalities have ordinances that aim to regulate noise emissions,
often by specifying limits on the noise levels in terms of average noise (such as LAeq)
and maximum event noise (such as LAFmax), and requiring that the entity responsible
for the noise source to take actions to be compliant.
However environmental noise is often characterized by being a complex mixture
of multiple time-dependent sources of noise,
making it resource-intensive to determine the source and responsible entity.
Wireless sensor networks can be used to monitor noise levels,
and recent advances in machine learning has also made it possible to automatically classify audio.
This can be used to automatically analyze the noise levels in terms of the the noise sources.
But what is the most appropriate way to compute noise levels per source,
needed to compare them to regulations?
In this work we present early work on multiple task formulations, such as
Noise Event Classification, Dominant Source Classification, and Noise Source Separation.

## Misc
Early work, only a poster at this time.
Might be better suited as a proper paper at a conference on Acoustics and Environmental Noise.
