# TODO

## Analyze results

- Plot overall results for all models, on all datasets
- Plot results for YAMNet and OpenL3, in context of other results
- Conclude

## Make slides
- Create presentation
- Rough pass on all slides

- Write down key points for each slide
- Time the presentation
- Make a video recording


# Result analysis

## Overall

What is the single best model?
Dominates the others most often

## YAMNet and OpenL3

What are the expecations going in?
Use published results. AudioSet ?

Which one is better, OpenL3 or YAMNet?

References.
- Best in task
- Best all-around
- Median performance
- 

Maybe boxplot / stripplot as ref.
Colorize ours. Gray/opacit the refs?


# Ideas


## Holistic emsembles
Ensemble all of the vectors together. How well does combined system perform?

Can one learn a holistic model, using the best performers as teachers?

Can a holistic model trained on N tasks, perform well on unseen tasks?
For which train/test combinations?
