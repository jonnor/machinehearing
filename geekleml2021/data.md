## Labeling

Know that there should be a quite regular pattern.
Distance between events should be near the same. With few outliers
And values in range.. 0.5 to 30 seconds 
And event length should be very regular.
From the event distance, and lengths, one can estimate expected number of events per time period
Can compare event count vs this. Desirable to have near 100
Can be used for hyper-parameter search



## Request for data

Intructions

Looking for realistic sound from typical brewing conditions,
not hi-fidelity audio.

Make a 1 minute of audio of your airlock during fermentation.
It can be anywhere in the process, from just getting started, to very active CO2 generation, to fading down.
Record in the location where you typically have your brew sitting.
Record using a standard phone/tablet or digital camera.
Record from a distance between 10 cm to 1 meter from airlock.

Try to avoid too much handling noise when operating the phone/camera.

Upload the video to Youtube. Can be Public or Unlisted.
Submit the data via this Google Form.
