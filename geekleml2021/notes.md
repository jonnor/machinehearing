# Abstract

Audio Events, or Acoustic Events, are individual distinct sounds.
Audio Event Detection (AED) is the task of detecting such sounds, returning precise times that each kind (class) of sound occurs.
This can be anything from detecting coffee-beans cracking while roasting, to gunshots on a shooting range, to noise made by construction works - all these are real applications the presenter has developed.
This practical talk will show how you can build such a system in Python, using machine learning models applied to audio.
The general approaches shown can also be applied to other sensor data such as vibrations, pressure etc.

# Extended Abstract

Audio Events, or Acoustic Events, are individual distinct sounds.
This could be the pop of popcorn kernels in a popcorn machine,
the cough of a patient,
a car that is passing by on a road,
or the sound of an alarm in an office building.

Audio Event Detection (AED) is the task of detecting such sounds,
returning precise times that each kind (class) of sound occurs.
It finds uses in music analysis, manufacturing, medicine and building management.

Steps
- Set up the supervised learning task from a collected dataset.
- Extract spectrogram features from audio waveforms.
- Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
- Run the trained model on an real-time audio stream.
- Process model output probabilties into discrete events.
- Evaluate the performance of the resulting AED system.

Example code in Python covering these aspects will be provided.
Libraries used with be Keras, TensorFlow and scikit-learn for machine learning,
and pysoundfile, PyAudio and librosa for audio processing,
with some numpy and pandas for general data manipulation.

Some general familiarity with supervised Machine Learning is recommended.
Familiarity with time-series or audio is a bonus, but not a pre-requisite.

# Calls to Action

Interested in working on Audio and ML?
- Apply at Soundsensing

Looking for monitoring solutions using Audio?
Use Soundsensing IoT sensors and Audio ML platform



# Demo

Ideal demo

- Concrete usecase
- Simple phenomenon
- Relatable, familiar
- Can use detected events to illustrate/uncover differences
Different event rates say something about other (potentially hidden) process variables.
Ie popcorn. Different brand of popcorn. Different conditions, ie humidity. Amount of beans
Change in events say when something has started or stopped.
- Can show detecting working in real-time
- Can share the data
- Data is easily accessible
- Labeled data exists already
Bird call?
- Fun and geeky

# TODO

- Collect initial audio data
- Run through standard classifiers, see how they do
- Run through spectrogram
- Run through soundlevels
- Label some 10-100 events per track, evaluate performance

Compute spectrograms
Generate labels using clustering.
Using GMM-HMM
Put Youtube files in csv

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Always inspect at the data
Listen to audio, look at spectrogram
Audacity open-source software

Characteristics of the sound
Make notes

Event length.
Distance between events
Variation
Changes over time
Differences between recordings
Background noise
Other events that could be easily confused


### Labeling data
Manually using Audacity


### Synthesize data
Using scaper
Vary SNR

## TODO

# Applications

Aka Sound Event Detection
Present/not.

Similar to.
Audio classification
Keyword spotting

## Data requirements

Go for at least 100 events
1 per second, 2 minutes

Baseline simple. Soundlevel/freq, RF
Baseline advanced. Pretrained audio CNN
Custom. Own CNN/RNN on spectrogram

# Planning
What people need to understand

- Audio events
What is an audio event.
Onset/offset
Definition of AED task. Input/outputs

- Typical audio ML pipeline
Analysis windows
Features over time
Spectrogram

- How to evaluate performance
Window-wise vs event-wise
sed_eval: https://tut-arg.github.io/sed_eval/
tolerances

What we will (mostly) assume that people know

- Basic digital audio
- Basic Machine Learning. Supervised classification
- Typical Neural Networks. CNN/RNN ?

Refer to EuroPython talk.


What people do not need to understand

- ? Weakly labeled data 
- Making efficient networks

Undecided

- Post-processing.
Counting. Threshold above X
Event-rate

Tips & tricks

- Error analysis
Manually examining mistakes that your algorithm is making

- Labeling strategies
Unsupervised learning. HMM GMM
Weakly labeled data
Semi-supervised
Alignment tools

- Pretrained model
OpenL3 / YAMNET / PANN

Challenges

- Out-of-distribution data
Device. Environment. 

## Requirements for AED

- Resolution of output. 
- Detection delay
- False Positive Rate / False Negative Rate
- Precision / recall

Things to consider
- Length of events. Min,max,median. Should fit into one window

## Examples

- Popcorn popping. Or coffeebeans
- Gunshot detection
- Bird call
- Cough
- Umm/aaa speech patterns
- Drum hit
- Alarm goes off
- Car passing
- Plop from alcohol fermentation lock

## Events vs not-events
Need to have a well-defined duration
Start-end. Onset/offset
Or at least a clear start

If events are overlapping a lot, might not make sense as events anymore
One hand clap versus clapping

For events one can count the number of occurrences
Classification might instead count number of seconds instead

## Approach
AED as classification of short independent time-windows
Uniform probability of event occuring.

Not considering sequences, or states, in the detector
Ie in speech recognition certain sequences of phonemes are more probable

Monophonic.
Binary classification

Requires that each event is clearly audible and understandable - without context
Low-to-no overlap

## Characteristics of Audio Events

- Duration
- Tonal/atonal
- Temporal patterns
- Percussive
- Frequency content
- Temporal envelope
- Foreground vs background
- Signal to Noise Ratio

Some events are short
Gunshot
Bark

Some are bit longer
Cat mjau

Some events are percussive / atonal.
Cough,  etc

Some have temporal patterns
Some are more tonal
Alarms

Transitions. Into state. Out of state.
