# Abstract

Audio Events, or Acoustic Events, are individual distinct sounds.
Audio Event Detection (AED) is the task of detecting such sounds, returning precise times that each kind (class) of sound occurs.
This can be anything from detecting coffee-beans cracking while roasting, to gunshots on a shooting range, to noise made by construction works - all these are real applications the presenter has developed.
This practical talk will show how you can build such a system in Python, using machine learning models applied to audio.
The general approaches shown can also be applied to other sensor data such as vibrations, pressure etc.

# Extended Abstract

Audio Events, or Acoustic Events, are individual distinct sounds.
This could be the pop of popcorn kernels in a popcorn machine,
the cough of a patient,
a car that is passing by on a road,
or the sound of an alarm in an office building.

Audio Event Detection (AED) is the task of detecting such sounds,
returning precise times that each kind (class) of sound occurs.
It finds uses in music analysis, manufacturing, medicine and building management.

Steps
- Set up the supervised learning task from a collected dataset.
- Extract spectrogram features from audio waveforms.
- Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
- Run the trained model on an real-time audio stream.
- Process model output probabilties into discrete events.
- Evaluate the performance of the resulting AED system.

Example code in Python covering these aspects will be provided.
Libraries used with be Keras, TensorFlow and scikit-learn for machine learning,
and pysoundfile, PyAudio and librosa for audio processing,
with some numpy and pandas for general data manipulation.

Some general familiarity with supervised Machine Learning is recommended.
Familiarity with time-series or audio is a bonus, but not a pre-requisite.

# Outline


## Audio Event Detection

Aka Sound Event Detection
Present/not.

Similar to.
Audio classification
Keyword spotting

Audio Classification with Machine Learning (Jon Nordby, EuroPython 2019)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCGROOUO_wY

## Events vs not-events

Events need to have a well-defined duration
Start-end. Onset/offset
Or at least a clear start

If events are overlapping a lot, might not make sense as events anymore
Isolated claps (event) versus clapping (ongoing, class)

For events one can count the number of occurrences
Classification might instead count number of seconds instead

## Beer fermentation tracking

IMAGE: graph over time

bubbles per minute 


Event length around 200 ms



## Approach
AED as classification of short independent time-windows
Uniform probability of event occuring.

Not considering sequences, or states, in the detector
Ie in speech recognition certain sequences of phonemes are more probable

Single audio stream. Monophonic.
Single event class. Binary classification

Requires that each event is clearly audible and understandable - without context
Low-to-no overlap between events.

## Data requirements

Need a minimum of 100 events
1 per second, just 2 minutes
1000 events better.
Much more stable performance metrics
10'000

Want realistic data. Capturing 

- natural variation in the event sound
- natural variation in recording devices
- natural variation in recording environment

Especially if there are other event-like noises

## Data collection

Searched on Youtube.

- Preferably couple of minutes long, minimum 15 seconds 
- No talking
- Mostly stationary camera
- No audio editing/effects
- One or more airlocks bubbling
- Bubbling can be heard by ear

Making note of

- Bubbling rate
- Clarity of bubble sound
- Other noise around

Maybe 1000 videos reviewed.
End up with around 100 potentialy useful
Took many hours

Up to 100 recording devices and 100 environments. Maybe 2000 events
Some recordings very long, several hours. Maybe 5000 events

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Always inspect at the data
Listen to audio, look at spectrogram
Audacity open-source software

Characteristics of the sound
Write down notes about it

- Event length
- Distance between events
- Variation in the event sound
- Changes over time
- Differences between recordings
- Background noises
- Other events that could be easily confused


### Labeling data

Manually using Audacity

How to Label Audio for Deep Learning in 4 Simple Steps
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-label-audio-for-deep-learning-in-4-simple-steps-6a2c33b343e6
Shows how to use Audacity to label.
Including switching to spectrograms,
annotating a frequency range,
exporting the labels to files,
and importing the label files in Python.


Semi-automatically with GMM-HMM
First running it, generating label files
Then reviewing and editing the labels in Audacity

Gaussian Mixture Model, Hidden Markov Model
from hmmlearn
https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn
Using Mel-Frequency-Cepstral-Coefficiants as features
Lossy compression on top of a mel-spectrogram




## Audio ML pipeline


## Analysis windows



## Evaluation

Multiple levels

Window-wise
- False Positive Rate / False Negative Rate
- Precision / recall

- Event-wise

- Blops per Minute
Errors within +- 20?


Other desirable properties
- Resolution of output. 
- Reporting delay
- Length of events. Min,max,median. Should fit into one window


## Models

Baseline simple. Soundlevel/freq, RF
Baseline advanced. Pretrained audio CNN
Custom. Own CNN/RNN on spectrogram





## Post-processing

Counting. Threshold above X
Event rate. Count / time



## Streaming inference

Operator does not care about each and every blop
BPM changes slowly and (normally) quite evently

Want ability to check a that fermentation is progressing OK.
Will maybe check couple of times per day 
Can have many minutes, perhaps up to 1 hour lag
Brewfather limits updates to once per 15 minutes

But can be useful when setting up, to verifify detection
And makes for nicer demo :)

Key: Chopping up incoming stream into (overlapping) audio windows


### Synthesize data

Using scaper
Vary SNR



## Other examples

- Popcorn popping. Or coffeebeans
- Gunshot detection
- Bird call
- Cough
- Umm/aaa speech patterns
- Drum hit
- Alarm goes off
- Car passing
- Plop from alcohol fermentation lock



# Bonus

## Characteristics of Audio Events

- Duration
- Tonal/atonal
- Temporal patterns
- Percussive
- Frequency content
- Temporal envelope
- Foreground vs background
- Signal to Noise Ratio

Some events are short
Gunshot
Bark

Some are bit longer
Cat mjau

Some events are percussive / atonal.
Cough,  etc

Some have temporal patterns
Some are more tonal
Alarms

Transitions. Into state. Out of state.






# Other

## Event Detection with Weakly Labeled data

TEASER

What if there was a way to learn Audio Event Detectors
without needing to annotated labels for each and every event?

Weekly labeled Audio Event Detection.
Feed in longer clips that either have the event(s) or not - without information about how many or where

Active area of research. DCASE
Speech recognition systems. Can give phone level output with sentence-level annotations 

Multiple Instance Learning
Principle model architecture with neural networks
Each (overlapped) analysis window in a clip goes through same neural network.
Outputs are pooled across time to make prediction of event present-or-not.
Common pooling operation: max, or softmax
More advanced. Attention pooling, or Autopool (softmax generalization)


## Error analysis

False Negatives / False Positives. Rank by probability
Can be generalized to multi-class. For example using pairwise-confusions. Expected-Actual



### Bias/variance diagnostics

High Variance problem: Training error much lower than test error
High Bias problem: Both training and test error high
Different strategies to fix the two cases

Diagnostic
Convergence failure.
Optimizing wrong loss function.
