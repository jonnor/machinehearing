Jon Nordby: The link "Audio Classification with Machine Learning (EuroPython 2019)" in your slides seems to be broken ("Video unavailable").
Jon Nordby: Apparently a typo in the URL

I want to measure my Keystrokes Per Minute :D

## Jon Nordby
Dusan Smitran: I think measuring Keystrokes per Minute could be fun. A nice thing is that one could use a keystroke counter on the machine to provide labeled data automatically. Not sure if an acoustic solution would compete with one that is tied into the OS input facilities though, but it is an interesting challenge!

Christoph Gietl: ah thanks, that is a good point. It was a local video. Will try to see if I can link to Youtube versions

Hi everyone. Thanks to all that attended the talk Sound Event Detection with Machine Learning! If you have any questions I am around for a bit to discuss. We can do this for example in the Breakout 4: Parrot room  :)
