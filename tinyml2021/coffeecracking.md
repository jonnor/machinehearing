# Acoustic detection of coffeebean cracking during roasting

## Type
Application

## Abstract

Great coffee requires not just high quality coffee beans,
but also a roasting process that consistently brings out the desired flavor and aroma.
During the roasting the coffee beans will pop like popcorn ("cracking"),
and the sound of these cracks is a good indicator of the development stage of the coffee. 
By using MEMS microphones and on-edge analysis using machine learning (TinyML),
the Roest coffee roasters can use sound to automatically keep track of the roasting process.
This technology has been developed in a collaboration between Roest and Soundsensing,
and is shipping on Roest sample roaster since August 2020.
In this talk you will hear about this fun and practical application of TinyML,
and some of the challenges and solutions we found when deploying on-edge
machine learning in professional grade electronics products.

## Press-release style

Roest is a leading manufacturer of coffee-roasting machines.
Their award-winning sample roaster is used by high-end coffee makers all over the world,
and is the first commercially available coffee roaster that uses acoustic sensing.

Soundsensing is a leader in acoustic monitoring using Machine Learning.
Their IoT sensors are used to monitor noise levels in workplaces and cities,
and to monitor the condition of machines and processes in manufacturing and real-estate.

The model runs on a custom developed board using an STM32 microcontroller and the X-CUBE-AI machine learning toolkit.
Roest coffee machines have been shipping with this TinyML-powered feature since August 2020.

## Notes

Who here likes Coffee?

Then you have come to the right talk!

Did you know that roasting coffee beans make them crack like popcorn?

During the roasting process the coffebeans heat up and
the water inside turns to steam.
This can be released abruptly through the hard shell,
resulting in an audible "crack".

Experienced coffee roasters often listen for these cracks.
But this requires constant virgilance,
making it hard to do other tasks at the same time.

But how do coffee-makers select their coffee?

Development process.
From the start and all the way to a validated solution,
system design, data collection, model development, and testing.
