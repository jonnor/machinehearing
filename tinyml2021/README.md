## Bio

Jon Nordby is a Machine Learning Engineer with 10 years of experience developing software for embedded systems and data processing of audio and images.
He holds a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from 2010, and a Master's degree in Data Science from 2019. His specialization is machine learning for audio and sensor data.
Since 2019 he is the CTO of Soundsensing, a leading provider of IoT sensor systems using sound as the primary data source.
Their systems are used for Noise Monitoring and Condition Monitoring of machinery.
Jon is also the creator of emlearn, an open-source machine learning toolkit for microcontrollers and embedded devices.
