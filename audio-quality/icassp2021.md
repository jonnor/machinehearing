https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15258

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Log power Mel spectrogram

ground truth human ratings obtained using ITU-T P.808
multi-stage self-teaching model inspired by continual life long learning [13] to learn in the presence of noisy labels
600 noisy speech test clips comprised of a combination of synthetic and real recordings,
covering 100 speakers and noise types

600 clips were processed by over 200 different noise suppression methods
120k clips total
average length of each audio clip was about 9 seconds

### PERCEPTUAL LOSS BASED SPEECH DENOISING WITH AN ENSEMBLE OF AUDIO PATTERN RECOGNITION AND SELF-SUPERVISED MODELS
https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11860

Perceptual Ensemble Regularization Loss (PERL)
Our best model (PERL-AE) only uses acoustic event model (utilizing AudioSet) to outperform state-of-the-art methods on major perceptual metrics
