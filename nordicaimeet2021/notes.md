# NORA Annual Conference

The NORA.startup segment will be divided into two sessions.


## Stand
All the startups who have signed up for a presentation will be given a dedicated space in a function room to set up a stand.
The stands will be open the entire second day of the conference.

https://www.nora.ai/nora-annual-conference/Nora.startup%20introductions/

## Presentation
At 15:00, members of NORA.startup will be invited to present their startups to the conference participants.
We will set aside 15 minutes for each startup, followed by a 5 min Q&A.

15:25-15:40

# Title
Combining Machine Learning and Acoustics for Noise Monitoring

# Text

Noise is a large problem on a socital level.
In Europe alone ---, 
which leads to sleep distrurbances and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. cite WHO 
Improvements in the capabilities and cost of embedded systems and Internet of Things
has made it easier to measure noise in terms of soundlevel over longer periods of time and at more locations.
However the sound level alone tells us very little about the causes of noise,
which must be understood in order to plan and validate remedies. 

The use of Machine Learning is starting to make it possible to automatically classify and detect events in audio,
and there is a growing body of existing research in relevant topics such as
Sound Event Detection, Environmental Sound Classification, and Acoustic Scene Classification. cite DCASE
However we find that most existing work does
not consider the relationship between the noise magnitude/severity (soundlevel)
with noise sources (classification).

Our ongoing research aims to find practical solutions for
automatically determining the source of measured noise,
by combining sound detection and classifaction techniques with
with soundlevel measurements according to current noise regulations and acoustical engineering practice.

Our contributions so far have shown that 
it is feasible to do on-sensor classification of environmental sound on low-cost microcontrollers, cite thesis
that Sound Event Detection (SED) at a known source can be used to create logbooks of noisy activity, cite ICSV27
and that doing SED at both source and receiver allows to determine the source of noise experienced at receiver. cite Brage/EuroNoise2021 

Current work focuses new task formulations for Machine Learning
that incorporate the requirements of acoustic modelling and noise regulations.
We hope that the formalization of these tasks will enable more research and increased relevance for
understanding acoustical noise using Machine Learning.

Our primary method of research involves case-studies and demonstrator projects in the real-world,
and we invite parties interested in noise, acoustics and machine learning to collaborate with us.

# Notes

Introduction

Noise impact on society
Modern technology improvements. MEMS microphones, IoT, Machine Learning
Lower costs for data collection. Lower cost for data analysis. 
Areas. Environmental noise. Leisure. Industrial. Transportation. HMS

Objective

Come up with practical solutions for monitoring noise at a location over time,
that can automatically attributes the correct noise source.
To gain a better understanding of causes and characteristics of noise at the location,
to document adherence to regulations and best-practices,
and form basis for corrective and preventive measures when issues are found.

Sub-Challenges

- Combining classification with soundlevels
- Selecting appropriate classes for acoustics.
Variations in regulations
Case-specific variations
- Privacy requirements for continious monitoring

Technical challenges

- Number of measurement points usually << number of noise source(s) and locations
- Noise sources may be unknown in number, location, and characteristics
- Highly diverse environments. Source characteristics, propagation, combinations

Findings

- Sound Event Detection can be used at known noise sources to log periods of noisy activity (PNB/ICSV27)
- SED can be used at both source and receiver,
in order to attribute noise at receiver to a known source, or other sources (PNB/EuroNoise2021)
- Environmental Sound Classification can be done on low-power microcontrollers (Master)
- Need for specialized task formulations that combine Acoustics and Machine Learning
